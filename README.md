###USAGE:

#####To copy vehicles: 

You MUST manually create/find a vehicle in the NEW world.

It MUST be named a UNIQUE name such as "MyTarget"

Your source vehicle must also have a unique name.


#####To copy characters:

Create a new character in the new world FIRST.

It will mark a safe place in the new world for the transfer.

I have tested this utility extensively, however it comes

with no promise or guarantee of success. Back up your world
